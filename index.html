            <h2>Menu Inventory</h2>
            <p>I created a menu inventory system for my class in CMSC 12. The project revolved around making a Recipe Book with an inventory 
            system in Python. This system should be able to store and follow a recipe, maintain a list of supplies as well as the suppliers 
            available in the system.</p>

        <div class="shooter-game card">
            <h2>Nebula Bulletstorm</h2>
            <p>I along with my partner in CMSC 22 created a space themed shooter game in java. You play as nebula, a 
            space ranger on a mission to defeat aliens and survive outer space for 60 seconds. Powerups will appear to you randomly throughout the duration of the game.</p>

            <h2>Ticketing Index</h2>
            <p> For CMSC 21, we created a ticketing index system for concerts. It shows the available concerts, available seats, as well as keeps track of who purchased the tickets and remaining stock.

            <h2>Email Bot</h2>
            <p>I created an email bot that automatically sends an email to a specified  email on a specific time each day for automation.

            <p>My name is Jesella B. Fermo. I was born December 25, 2001 (Merry Christmas!). I have a sister who is takign BS Biology in UPD. As a child, I was always drawn to technology due to exposure to my dad's computer and old gaming consoles. Fast-forward to junior high, I had an ICT class for the first time and I really enjoyed programming and my teacher then told me that I could pursue his field of work since the tech industry is ever-growing and it could be a viable career option for me. Needless to say, I followed his advice and here I am now, a second-year student taking BS- Computer Science in UPLB. Programming is really fun but challenging at the same time. I know that the path I have chosen is not all rainbows and butterflies, but nothing fruitful comes from taking life easy. As for the future... well, my end goal is to work at google.   </p>
